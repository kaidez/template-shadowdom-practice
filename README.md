# Web Components: Template & Shadow DOM Practice

This is some really simple Web Components code I hacked together, just so I could better understand how all this works. It mainly templates focuses on but also uses a little Shadow DOM.

I'm still working on this but will (hopefully) write about this later...either in this README or in a blog post at [kaidez.com](http://kaidez.com).
